[extension] Compiling the JIT fused_optim_cuda kernel during runtime now
Some weights of ViTForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- classifier.bias: found shape torch.Size([1000]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([3]) in the model instantiated
- classifier.weight: found shape torch.Size([1000, 768]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([3, 768]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
